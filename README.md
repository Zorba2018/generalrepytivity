# General Relativity

`generalrelativity` holds some algorithms that render useful when doing computations related to general relativity. For a first tutorial, take a look at [this jupyter notebook](https://gist.github.com/miguelgondu/0e8ba345f25b6c9ab007084e472202c8); for a second tutorial, take a look at [this other jupyter notebook](https://gist.github.com/miguelgondu/55b1ee946153efaf3541da8660489639).
